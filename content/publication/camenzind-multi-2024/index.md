abstract: High throughput field phenotyping techniques employing multispectral cameras
  allow extracting a variety of variables and features to predict yield and yield
  related traits, but little is known about which types of multispectral features
  are optimal to forecast yield potential in the early growth phase. In this study,
  we aim to identify multispectral features that are able to accurately predict yield
  and aid in variety classification at different growth stages throughout the season.
  Furthermore, we hypothesize that texture features (TFs) are more suitable for variety
  classification than for yield prediction. Throughout 2021 and 2022, a trial involving
  19 and 18 European wheat varieties, respectively, was conducted. Multispectral images,
  encompassing visible, Red-edge, and near-infrared (NIR) bands, were captured at
  19 and 22 time points from tillering to harvest using an unmanned aerial vehicle
  (UAV) in the first and second year of trial. Subsequently, orthomosaic images were
  generated, and various features were extracted, including single-band reflectances,
  vegetation indices (VI), and TFs derived from a gray level correlation matrix (GLCM).
  The performance of these features in predicting yield and classifying varieties
  at different growth stages was assessed using random forest models. Measurements
  during the flowering stage demonstrated superior performance for most features.
  Specifically, Red reflectance achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 52.4 g
  m-2 in the first year and 64.4 g m-2 in the second year. The NDRE VI yielded the
  most accurate predictions with an RMSE of 49.1 g m-2 and 60.6 g m-2, respectively.
  Moreover, TFs such as CONTRAST and DISSIMILARITY displayed the best performance
  in predicting yield, with RMSE values of 55.5 g m-2 and 66.3 g m-2 across the two
  years of trial. Combining data from different dates enhanced yield prediction and
  stabilized predictions across dates. TFs exhibited high accuracy in classifying
  low and high-yielding varieties. The CORRELATION feature achieved an accuracy of
  88% in the first year, while the HOMOGENEITY feature reached 92% accuracy in the
  second year. This study confirms the hypothesis that TFs are more suitable for variety
  classification than for yield prediction. The results underscore the potential of
  TFs derived from multispectral images in early yield prediction and varietal classification,
  offering insights for HTP and precision agriculture alike.
