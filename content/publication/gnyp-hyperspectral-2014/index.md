abstract: 'Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Ratio Vegetation Index obtained
  with the fixed band GreenSeeker active multispectral canopy sensor (GS-NDVI and
  GS-RVI) have been commonly used to non-destructively estimate crop growth parameters
  and support precision crop management, but their performance has been influenced
  by soil and/or water backgrounds at early crop growth stages and saturation effects
  at moderate to high biomass conditions. Our objective is to improve estimation of
  rice (Oryza sativa L.) aboveground biomass (AGB) with hyperspectral canopy sensing
  by identifying more optimal measurements using one or more strategies: (a) soil
  adjusted Vegetation Indices (VIs); (b) optimized narrow band RVI and NDVI; and (c)
  Optimum Multiple Narrow Band Reflectance (OMNBR) models based on raw reflectance,
  and its first and second derivatives (FDR and SDR).  Six rice nitrogen (N) rate
  experiments were conducted in Jiansanjiang, Heilongjiang province of Northeast China
  from 2007 to 2009 to create different biomass conditions. Hyperspectral field data
  and AGB samples were collected at four growth stages from tillering through heading
  from both experimental and farmers’ fields. The results indicate that six-band OMNBR
  models (R2 = 0.44–0.73) explained 21–35% more AGB variability relative to the best
  performing fixed band RVI or NDVI at different growth stages. The FDR-based 6-band
  OMNBR models explained 4%, 6% and 8% more variability of AGB than raw reflectance-based
  6-band OMNBR models at the stem elongation (R2 = 0.77), booting (R2 = 0.50), and
  heading stages (R2 = 0.57), respectively. The SDR-based 6-band OMNBR models made
  no further improvements, except for the stem elongation stage. Optimized RVI and
  NDVI for each growth stage (R2 = 0.34–0.69) explained 18–26% more variability in
  AGB than the best performing fixed band RVI or NDVI. The FDR- and SDR-based optimized
  VIs made no further improvements. These results were consistent across different
  sites and years. It is concluded that with suitable band combinations, optimized
  narrow band RVI or NDVI could significantly improve estimation of rice AGB at different
  growth stages, without the need of derivative analysis. Six-band OMNBR models can
  further improve the estimation of AGB over optimized 2-band VIs, with the best performance
  using SDR at the stem elongation stage and FDR at other growth stages.'
