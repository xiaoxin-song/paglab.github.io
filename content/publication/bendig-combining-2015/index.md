abstract: 'In this study we combined selected vegetation indices (VIs) and plant height
  information to estimate biomass in a summer barley experiment. The VIs were calculated
  from ground-based hyperspectral data and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based red
  green blue (RGB) imaging. In addition, the plant height information was obtained
  from UAV-based multi-temporal crop surface models (CSMs). The test site is a summer
  barley experiment comprising 18 cultivars and two nitrogen treatments located in
  Western Germany. We calculated five VIs from hyperspectral data. The normalised
  ratio index (NRI)-based index GnyLi (Gnyp et al., 2014) showed the highest correlation
  (R2 = 0.83) with dry biomass. In addition, we calculated three visible band VIs:
  the green red vegetation index (GRVI), the modified GRVI (MGRVI) and the red green
  blue VI (RGBVI), where the MGRVI and the RGBVI are newly developed VI. We found
  that the visible band VIs have potential for biomass prediction prior to heading
  stage. A robust estimate for biomass was obtained from the plant height models (R2
  = 0.80–0.82). In a cross validation test, we compared plant height, selected VIs
  and their combination with plant height information. Combining VIs and plant height
  information by using multiple linear regression or multiple non-linear regression
  models performed better than the VIs alone. The visible band GRVI and the newly
  developed RGBVI are promising but need further investigation. However, the relationship
  between plant height and biomass produced the most robust results. In summary, the
  results indicate that plant height is competitive with VIs for biomass estimation
  in summer barley. Moreover, visible band VIs might be a useful addition to biomass
  estimation. The main limitation is that the visible band VIs work for early growing
  stages only.'
